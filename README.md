# Express API Starter with TypeScript

This project serves as a boilerplate for setting up an Express API with TypeScript. It includes various dependencies and development utilities to aid in building, testing, and deploying your API.

## Features

- **Morgan**: HTTP request logger middleware for Node.js
- **Helmet**: Helps secure your Express apps by setting various HTTP headers
- **Dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`
- **CORS**: Node.js package for providing a Connect/Express middleware to enable CORS

### Development Utilities

- **TypeScript**: A language for application-scale JavaScript
- **ts-node**: TypeScript execution and REPL for node.js, with source map and native ESM support
- **Nodemon**: Tool that automatically restarts the node application when file changes are detected
- **ESLint**: Tool for identifying and reporting patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code
- **TypeScript-eslint**: Tooling which enables ESLint to support TypeScript
- **Jest**: Delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity
- **Supertest**: HTTP assertions made easy via superagent

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Linting

To lint your code for potential errors or style inconsistencies:

```sh
npm run lint
```

## Testing

To run Jest tests:

```sh
npm run test
```

## Example Usage

```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/https%3A%2F%2Fgamn.vid109d224.site%2F_v2-akxm%2F12a3c523f3105800ed8c394685aeeb0b902efc5c03b8e5ed42407baea93ece832257df1a4b6125fcfa38c35da05dee86aad28d46d73fc4e9d4e5a47f0720afd036c212a65a48af5a449df7ee3b127d136665d43410043fc694d3e0138cf97e997d47a31c0763fc14b6aa61%2Fh%2Fd3%2Fecaabdfec%3B15a38634f803584ba8926411d7bee906856cab0654b5b8.m3u8
```

## API Endpoint

The API endpoint is defined as:

```
host/:uricomponentEncoded(m3u8)
```

This endpoint expects a URL-encoded URI component representing a `.m3u8` file path.

```
